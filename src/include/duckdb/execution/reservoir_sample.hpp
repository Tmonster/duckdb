// whats the issue with sotring percentage samples in local state?
// mostly with merging
// if you have multiple unfinished samples during merging, then each unfinished sample needs to be merged
// The problem is if you have two samples that have seen below the reservoir threashold, but they have
// weights etc.
// I.e
// Sample 1 has 40,000 tuples after seeing 68640 rows.
// Sample 2 has 40,000 tuples after seeing 85600 rows.
//
// Desired result after merging is
// Sample (1+2) has 40,000 tuples after seeing 100,000 rows
// Sample 3 has 8640 tuples after seeing 54,240 rows
//           - all samples in sample 3 have the weights from when they were in sample 2.
